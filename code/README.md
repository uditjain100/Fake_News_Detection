# Detecting Fake and Counterfeit News in Social Media

## Project Overview

In this project, a diverse set of 29 machine learning algorithms were utilized to evaluate the veracity of news articles, enhancing the reliability and trustworthiness of information shared on social media platforms.

## Algorithms Used

The project employs the following 29 AI algorithms:

1. L-BFGS (Limited-memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno)
2. Liblinear
3. Newton-CG (Newton Conjugate Gradient)
4. SAG (Stochastic Average Gradient)
5. RandomForest
6. Perceptron
7. RidgeClassifier
8. CatBoost
9. NearestCentroid
10. SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent)
11. SVC-linear (Support Vector Classifier with Linear Kernel)
12. SVC-gamma (Support Vector Classifier with Gamma Kernel)
13. LinearSVC
14. ZeroR
15. DecisionTree
16. PassiveAggressive
17. ExtraTree
18. RandomPatches
19. Voting Classifier
20. SG (Stochastic Gradient)
21. MLP (Multilayer Perceptron)
22. BernoulliRBM (Bernoulli Restricted Boltzmann Machine)
23. AdaBoost
24. GradientBoosting
25. OrdinalLearningModel
26. XGBoost
27. DecisionStump
28. ComplementNB (Complement Naive Bayes)
29. MultinomialNB (Multinomial Naive Bayes)

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories and files:

- **dataset/**: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the models.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks with exploratory data analysis and model training. These notebooks also contain python scripts for preprocessing, training, and evaluating models. Evaluation results, performance metrics, and visualizations.
- **README.md**: Project documentation (this file).

## Installation

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rotex5/Fake_News_Detection.git

2. **Run Jupter NoteBook:**
   ```
   Run Jupter notebook application and navigate via browser to `Fake_News_Detection` directory
   Run Notebooks

## Results

The performance of each model is evaluated based on various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score and more. Detailed results and visualizations can be viewed as soon as notebooks is done executing.
