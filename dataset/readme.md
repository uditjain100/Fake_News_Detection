## Data Collection 

1. Dataset 1:
    This dataset of political news was taken out of Kaggle, it was a dataset compiled and provided for a community prediction competition. It consists of 25116 rows of train data. Each containing id, title, author, text and label columns. And 5864 rows of test data. Each also containing id, title, author, and text columns. This dataset was one of four datasets used in train our different machine learning models.

2. Dataset 2:
    The second dataset came from the University of Victoriaâ€™s Online Academic Community. Thousands of false news and real articles are combined to create this fake news dataset. The dataset was assembled from a number of stories published on both reputable and shady news websites.

3. Dataset 3:
    A publicly accessible dataset for identifying false news is called LIAR. POLITIFACT.COM offers a thorough analytical report and links to the original documents for each case, where 12.8K manually labeled brief utterances were gathered over a ten-year period in a variety of circumstances. Research that involves fact-checking can also make use of this dataset. It's interesting to note that this new dataset is orders of magnitude larger than prior, comparable public fake news databases. The LIAR dataset contains 12.8K human labelled brief statements from POLITIFACT.COM's API; a POLITIFACT.COM editor verifies each statement.

4. Dataset 4:
    The fourth dataset was obtained via the https://zenodo.org/record/4561253 page on the Zenodo website. The WELFake dataset, which contains 72,134 news stories, has 35,028 true and 37,106 fraudulent news. These are arranged in columns for text, label, serial number, and title. The news heading is represented by the title, the news content is by the text, and the label indicates if the news is true or fake (0 being fake and 1 being real). The serial number begins at 0. Just 72,134 of the roughly 78,098 records are accessible according to the data set
